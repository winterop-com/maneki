/**
 * How this app is painted.
 *
 * TWO INDEPENDENT AXES, AND KEEPING THEM APART IS THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT. The **mode** is light
 * or dark: next-themes owns it, writes it as a `dark` class on `<html>`, and follows the
 * operating system until somebody says otherwise. The **palette** is which set of colours the
 * app spends inside that mode: this module owns it, writes it as `data-theme` on the same
 * element, and every palette is designed for both modes. Neither axis knows about the other.
 *
 * WHERE THE COLOURS ARE. Nowhere near here. A palette is a block of custom-property overrides
 * in index.css hung off `html[data-theme='<name>']`, beside the base one. This module carries
 * the names and nothing else, so adding a palette is a block of CSS plus one row in `PALETTES`.
 * The same blocks answer to `[data-palette='<name>']`, which is what lets the swatch card on the
 * Theme pane paint one palette's tokens while the app is wearing another.
 *
 * APPLIED BEFORE FIRST PAINT, by the inline script in index.html rather than here. A palette
 * read in a React effect arrives one frame after the document does, and every load flashes the
 * default under whatever was actually chosen. That script reads the same storage key this
 * module writes, so the store below starts on the palette the document is already painted in.
