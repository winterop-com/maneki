/**
 * Everything the command palette can do, as data.
 *
 * A REGISTRY RATHER THAN A FUNCTION OF THE WHOLE APP. The shell registers the entries that are
 * always there -- every page, the appearance rows, sign out -- and a screen registers what only
 * it can do while it is mounted, and takes those rows away again when it unmounts. So the
 * palette on the runs page offers what the runs page offers, and nothing has to hold a list of
 * every screen's actions in one place.
 *
 * THE FILTER IS A PURE FUNCTION over the registered rows, which is what makes the whole action
 * surface testable in plain Node: the failures worth catching are a page missing from the list,
 * a row that cannot be found by a word in its own title, and a screen whose rows outlive it.
 *
 * EVERY CHORD THIS APP BINDS IS A LETTER. `lib/shortcuts` says why, and offers each of them as
 * a row here as well, because a shortcut nobody has been told about is a shortcut nobody has.
