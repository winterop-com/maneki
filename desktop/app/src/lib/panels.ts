/**
 * How the shell is laid out, and what survives a reload.

 * PX-INTENT. The right panel's width is kept in pixels, not as a fraction of the window,
 * because what somebody dragged it to was a decision about the content in it -- "wide enough
 * for a log line", "narrow enough to leave the table readable" -- and a fraction re-decides
 * that every time the window is resized. A window narrower than the stored width clamps for
 * that session and leaves the stored number alone, so the intent comes back with the window.
 *
 * Three small facts, three module stores, each read straight out of storage as it is built so
 * the shell renders at its settled size on the first paint rather than snapping into place.
