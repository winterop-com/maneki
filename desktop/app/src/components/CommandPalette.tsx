/**
 * The palette: a renderer over the registered actions, and nothing more.
 *
 * THE FILTERING IS NOT cmdk's. cmdk scores by its own fuzzy match over the rendered text, which
 * ranks a screen's own name below whichever row happens to share more letters with the query.
 * `filterActions` is this app's rule, it is a pure function, and it has a test -- so `shouldFilter`
 * is off here and the list handed to cmdk is already the answer, in order.
 *
 * THE SCREEN'S OWN SHELF LEADS, which `shelve` decides and this only draws. Somebody who opened
 * the palette while reading a run wants something to do with that run more often than they want
 * a navigation row, and the shelf's heading names what it is scoped to.
 *
 * CHOOSING CLOSES FIRST, THEN RUNS. An action that navigates while its own dialog is still on
 * screen leaves the new page under a modal for a frame.
