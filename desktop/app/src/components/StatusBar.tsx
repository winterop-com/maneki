/**
 * The line along the foot of the app: settings, who this is, and what the screen is doing.
 *
 * ONE ELEMENT ACROSS THE WHOLE WIDTH, WITH CELLS INSIDE IT. The rail's foot and the status
 * line were two elements each drawing its own top border, and two borders meeting at a column
 * edge is a rule that can come apart -- a pixel of rounding, a rung changed on one of them,
 * and the bottom of the app reads as a step. So the border is drawn once, by the bar; the
 * divider between the cells is drawn inside it; and the settings cell is the rail's width
 * because it reads the same store the rail does, drag and collapse included.
 *
 * ONE ROW, ALWAYS THE SAME HEIGHT, whatever it happens to be saying. A bar that grew when it
 * had something to report would move the page under it, so what it holds is short facts and
 * never a sentence.
 *
 * TWO OF THEM ARE THE SCREEN'S. A screen states a note and an identifier through
 * `lib/screen-status` while it is mounted -- where a run's one event stream is, and the trace
 * the run is on -- and the bar draws them without knowing which screen wrote them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS INSTANCE IS BELONGS TO THE TOP STRIP, NOT HERE. A fact appears once in the shell,
 * and the identity up there already carries the server's name and its version.
